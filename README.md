# Image-Classification-using-QCNN
Development of a quantum convolutional neural network for image classification. This code specializes in binary classification. Different convolution and embedding methods will be used for testing.  

The whole project is written in python. Tensorflow and numpy is required for the data treatment. The quantum simulation is done using the framework [pennylane](https://pennylane.ai/)

This work takes direct inspiration from this [previous work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00661)
